  As libraries move away from collections-based models toward access-based models, 
  with online catalogues, digital book collections, and online journal subscriptions, 
  their websites take on greater importance. It is fast approaching the point 
  where a library has as great a presence with their website as with their physical 
  building, if not more. It is therefore imperative that a library&#8217;s website 
  is logical, helpful, and user-friendly. Carole A. George, in User-Centred Library 
  Websites: Usability Evaluation Methods, argues that libraries need to create 
  user-centred websites and involve users in their creation to ensure such websites 
  are user-friendly.</p>
<p ><br>
  User-Centred Library Websites is a guide to various usability evaluation techniques 
  employed in designing user-centred websites. Libraries wishing to create a new 
  website or to update their existing one would do well to consult George&#8217;s 
  book for ideas on how to involve end-users in the website creation and testing 
  process to make the most of their web presence.</p>
<p ><br>
  George begins in Chapter 1 by defining user-centred design. &#8220;Simply stated, 
  user-centred design refers to how easy a product, website or computer-based 
  system is to use based on the users&#8217; perceptions&#8221; (p.3). The author 
  touches upon why libraries need user-centred websites, citing changing user 
  needs and increasing numbers of online services that libraries provide. If users 
  do not find a website easy to use, they will move onto other sites, thus the 
  library&#8217;s web presence diminishes. George moves on to how to get started 
  in Chapter 2, such as by assembling a development team, setting evaluation plans 
  and goals, and recruiting participants. Since user-friendliness hinges upon 
  the users&#8217; perceptions, the author argues in Chapter 3 that libraries 
  need to conduct a user needs analysis in order to ascertain the end-users&#8217; 
  computer skills, knowledge, goals for using the website, tasks they desire to 
  accomplish, and their expectations. George details the processes involved in 
  surveys, questionnaires, and interviews.</p>
<p ><br>
  In Chapter 4, she urges libraries to include users in the website development 
  cycle to provide timely feedback and to inform the design process. Users can 
  participate in the early design stages through affinity diagramming, card sorting, 
  and prototyping. George&#8217;s suggestion of card sorting is an excellent one, 
  since participants organize website information, such as documents and links, 
  into categories and labels that make sense to them as end-users. Far too often, 
  library websites are organized according to a librarian perspective and are 
  not as useful to end-users as they could be. A librarian&#8217;s tolerance for 
  information overload is greater than the average person&#8217;s.</p>
<p ><br>
  In Chapter 5 George explains how inspection methods can be used to test the 
  usability of a website. For example, heuristic evaluations require expert reviewers 
  to judge a website based upon a set of usability standards. Expert reviewers 
  can also inspect a website with cognitive walkthroughs, where they complete 
  tasks on prototypes and estimate how end-users would fare.</p>
<p > The meat of the book takes place in Chapter 6, concerning usability testing. 
  Here George provides helpful advice on how to create effective task scenarios, 
  which are commonly used in usability testing. Participants are given real life 
  scenarios to complete tasks that test the website&#8217;s functions. George 
  advises to pair scenarios with each website objective, to write the scenarios 
  in the users&#8217; language, to keep the scenarios short as opposed to writing 
  a long set of instructions, and to arrange the scenarios in a logical order. 
  In this chapter, the author also provides tips on how to conduct usability sessions. 
  Examples include suggested questions facilitators could choose to prompt participants 
  to think aloud during the sessions. Having participated in usability testing 
  before, I can attest that facilitators are sometimes at a loss as to how to 
  prompt participants to think aloud, which can be awkward for the participants 
  to do. In my experience, the facilitator spoke over the intercom, merely reminding 
  me, &#8220;You&#8217;re not thinking out loud enough!&#8221; George&#8217;s 
  suggestions would have better success eliciting the behavior facilitators would 
  like to see. It is curious however, that although George details the materials 
  and environments needed to conduct usability testing, including video and audio 
  recording equipment, she neglects to mention eye-tracking software (Schiessl 
  2003, Jacob 2004), an emerging tool in usability testing.</p>
<p ><br>
  The author ends the book with Chapter 7 on how to communicate the findings, 
  cataloging the characteristics of written reports and presentations. In the 
  appendix are examples of a recruiting email, screening questionnaire, usability 
  testing introduction, scenario task sheet, post-test questionnaire, informed 
  consent form, and a heuristic evaluation form. The book includes a glossary 
  of terms and an index.<br>
  For every method described in the book, George illustrates what it is, what 
  is the method&#8217;s objective, who are the participants, how long it will 
  take, what materials are needed, where the activity is held, and what are the 
  advantages and disadvantages. She also provides examples of how to plan and 
  facilitate each session. These examples give the reader a picture of what the 
  sessions will look like and walk the reader through the stages of the sessions.</p>
<p ><br>
  Since every method is broken down and structured around its objectives, advantages, 
  and disadvantages, etc., the text tends to repeat itself and uses similar language 
  from method to method. Reading the book straight through can become repetitive. 
  Because of this, the book reads less like a conventional discussion and more 
  like a reference guide. It seems to be ideally suited for library staff who 
  are conducting in-house usability studies and who may have little experience 
  facilitating such sessions. Any librarian, regardless of experience, can turn 
  to User-Centred Library Websites, look up a method they would like to try, and 
  refer to valuable advice, tips, and examples of how to conduct the sessions. 
  The examples provided in the appendix are especially helpful to novice facilitators. 
  Not every librarian serving on a website design committee has had experience 
  writing an informed consent form, for example. One could use the form George 
  provides or model one after it to save time.</p>
<p ><br>
  The author seems to have had academic libraries in mind when writing. She addresses 
  universities and college libraries (p.29), and not public libraries, for instance. 
  This makes sense, since the author comes from an academic library background. 
  It should be noted, however, that any librarian can adopt the methods in the 
  book, be they academic, public, school, archivist, or competitive intelligence 
  librarians. The methods range from very formal to informal, with settings and 
  equipment ranging from laboratories to office spaces.<br>
  Librarians serving on website design committees would appreciate User-Centered 
  Library Websites for its ideas on the design process and usability testing in 
  the creation of a user-friendly website. By making sure their website is intuitive 
  to end-users, libraries can better meet their users&#8217; needs, and strengthen 
  their presence in the ever competitive web world.</p>
