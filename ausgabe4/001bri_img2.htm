      The different language games involved in IR for a document-mediating system. 
      A substantial part of the challenges facing LIS. are not so much technical 
      difficulties as socio-linguistic difficulties of making concepts communicate 
      within and across different types of language games. The user has his own 
      language game, but also must handle documents with a language game of their 
      own determined by their authors, ordered by the language game of a classification 
      system, indexed according to the language game of the indexer, and searched 
      for in the language game of the search language. If the user has someone 
      to help, then this problem will be further interpreted through the language 
      game of the mediator (often that of the librarian or documentalist).</td>
