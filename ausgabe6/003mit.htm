            <p align="left" class="textueberschrift1">Prison Library Background 
            </p>
            <p class="text">State and Federal prisons house convicted inmates 
              who are incarcerated for longer periods than inmates in jails and 
              detention centers. Offenders in jails and detention centers are 
              either waiting judicial determination or serving short-term sentences. 
              State and Federal prisons provide services, including libraries 
              for individuals in their prisons, while jails and detention center 
              inmates receive services from their local counties. This article 
              will focus primarily on library services in State prisons.</p>
            <p class="text">Prisons were first established to banish and confine 
              the offender, subjecting him or her to hard labor. Reading was confined 
              to the Bibles and similar religious material aimed at inculcating 
              morality, the guardian of this genre was the prison chaplain, whose 
              responsibility was to assure the reader&#8217;s penitence.</p>
            <p><span class="text">The establishment of groups like <em>The American 
              Library Association</em>, <em>The American Correctional Association</em>, 
              and the <em>American Prison Association</em>, nurtured the movement 
              towards developing standards for new and improved library services. 
              This resulted in the publication of <em>Prison Library Handbook</em> 
              that was still aimed at &#8222;moral therapy&#8221;, but by 1992, 
              <em>Library Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions</em> was 
              drafted by Correctional Institutions librarians and State library 
              consultants.[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span class="text">] 
              </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Over time, many factors contributed to the development 
              of prison libraries to provide the improved breadth and quality 
              of services that exist today. Changes were fueled by: the prison 
              reform movement that advocated rehabilitation over punishment, education 
              for a successful reentry to the community, the rights of prisoners, 
              and the 1977 landmark court case, <em>Bounds vs. Smith</em> mandating 
              that prisoners have law libraries and access to legal help.[<a name="f2b" id="f2b"></a></span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span class="text">] 
              States interpreted <em>Bounds</em> in a variety of ways &#8211; 
              some established law libraries in the prisons, providing the required 
              core collection of legal materials and the hours of access, others 
              hired legal firms, yet others using the <em>Library Standards</em> 
              as guidelines and supported services that were established on the 
              model of public libraries.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Since the 1980s, public and political attitudes 
              have reverted to favoring punishment, and in 1994, The United States 
              Supreme Court in <em>Lewis vs. Casey</em> placed restrictions on 
              inmates&#8217; rights of access to the courts.[<a name="f3b" id="f3b"></a></span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span class="text">] 
              Consequently, many states have reduced their educational and library 
              services while increasing their expenditures on security.<a name="zw2"></a></span></p>
            <p class="text"> <span class="textueberschrift1"><strong>Prison Demographics</strong> 
              </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">In 2005, State and Federal prisons, local jails, 
              and detention centers held over 2 million prisoners who are parents 
              to approximately 1.5 million children under age 18. Estimates are 
              that 32 % of African Americans, 17 % Hispanic, and 5.9 % white males 
              will enter the state or federal prison system, at some point. In 
              2001, 6.6 % of State inmates were women, and 4 % of all prisoners 
              were not U.S. citizens. At some point 95 % of State prisoners will 
              return to the community.[<a name="f4b" id="f4b"></a></span><a href="#f4" class="back">Fn4</a><span class="text">] 
              <a name="zw3"></a> </span><span class="text"> </span> </p>
            <p class="textueberschrift1">The Library Standards</p>
            <p class="text">The Library Standards is the benchmark for establishing 
              and maintaining prison library services. It outlines access, minimum 
              standards for staffing, budget, facility size, and collection &#8211; 
              elements that are necessary for the provision of acceptable library 
              services in adult state and federal correctional facilities. It 
              includes the <em>American Library Association&#8217;s Bill of Rights</em>, 
              T<em>he Resolution on Prisoners&#8217; Right to Read</em>, <em>The 
              Freedom to Read</em>, and <em>The Freedom to View</em>. Prison Librarians 
              aim to emulate the Public Library&#8217;s role of libraries as community 
              information center, formal education support center, independent 
              learning center, popular materials library, and reference library. 
              However, services and facilities vary among and within States, depending 
              on State politics, individual warden&#8217;s philosophy, budget, 
              and also the nature of the institution. Certain prison facilities 
              are concerned about compliance with Federal guidelines for access 
              to the courts and have little interest in general library services. 
              Others, recognizing the importance of rehabilitation for successful 
              reentry into the community, have supported library collections and 
              services that encourage information seeking and reading for pleasure 
              or for self-help.<a name="zw4"></a></p>
            <p class="textueberschrift1">Collections</p>
            <p class="text">Prisoners have the same information needs as persons 
              in regular society, but with a greater number of them having low 
              education skills, they experience difficulties in articulating their 
              information needs or in their attempts to seek information. </p>
            <p><span class="text">In 2003, this writer used an online prison library 
              listserv to gather information about collection, services, staffing, 
              and programs for prisoners.[<a href="#f5"><a name="f5b" id="f5b"></a></a></span><a href="#f5" class="back">Fn5</a><span class="text">] 
              An analysis of the responses indicated that while services varied, 
              all librarians aim to create a balanced collection similar to that 
              of a public library. Generally their reference collections comprise 
              almanacs, dictionaries, encyclopedias, directories and legal databases. 
              The general collection includes non-fiction and fiction bestsellers, 
              low level/high interest materials, homegrown newspapers and magazines.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Popular non-fiction reading interest includes self-help, 
              career, biographies, poetry, medical, psychology, religion, art, 
              true crime, sports, body building, writing, paranormal. Popular 
              fiction genre includes horror, mystery, action/adventure, romance, 
              and science fiction. Most libraries stock the classics although 
              this was generally not a high interest item among the populations. 
              They keep this genre because they are primarily donations from the 
              public, and it is part of ensuring a well-rounded collection. There 
              is constant demand, but never an adequate supply of multicultural 
              literature especially materials by and about African American history 
              and heritage.</p>
            <p class="text">Collections and services are limited or almost non-existent 
              for non-English speaking prisoners. Lack of budget and inability 
              to communicate due to language differences are reasons for this 
              deficit. One librarian stated she relies on the help of bilingual 
              inmates to help her communicate with other Spanish-speaking patrons. 
              Currently there is an intense political national anti-immigrant 
              movement, and a debate advocating English only as the official language. 
              This will undoubtedly have a negative impact on efforts to improve 
              collections and services for the non English-speaking individuals 
              among the prison population.<a name="zw5"></a></p>
            <p class="textueberschrift1">Budget/Funding</p>
            <p class="text">Library programs are largely funded from <em>Inmate 
              Welfare Fund</em>, derived from the markups on inmates&#8217; telephone 
              calls and commissary purchases. When there are budget constraints, 
              the library and education programs are the most likely departments 
              to have their services reduced or eliminated. There have been a 
              few cases where library space was taken over and converted to living 
              quarters for new prisoners, and book budgets were cut to the extent 
              that some libraries report that their collection consists mainly 
              of donated items. Where state prisons have library coordinators, 
              they often seek supplemental funding by writing grants, or try to 
              enhance service by establishing more collaborative efforts with 
              relevant library or community partners.</p>
            <p><span class="text">Many prison librarians enhance their programs 
              and services by taking advantage of Federal funds available from 
              IMLS through Library Service and Technology Act (LSTA).[<a name="f6b" id="f6b"></a></span><a href="#f6" class="back">Fn6</a><span class="text">] 
              For example, Maryland Correctional Education Libraries (MCEL) has 
              used LSTA funds to purchase: a selection of books in world languages, 
              primarily Spanish, a small selection of books on English as a second 
              language, Spanish/English legal dictionaries for reference, several 
              bilingual dictionaries for circulation, a computer dedicated to 
              multicultural information including a Spanish/English dictionary 
              on CD- Rom, downloaded websites with directories of addresses for 
              Spanish speaking individuals, and published a list of Spanish titles 
              in the library.</span></p>
            <p class="text">MCEL also used LSTA funds to purchase large print 
              books, close caption televisions for deaf inmates, audio books, 
              videotapes, and listening devices. Inmates with visual impairment 
              may get appropriate materials and equipment from the Library for 
              the Blind and Physically Handicapped, as part of Maryland State 
              Library Resource Center.<span class="text"><a name="zw6"></a></span></p>
            <p class="textueberschrift1">Staffing</p>
            <p><span class="text">Although <em>The Standards</em> recommend minimum 
              staffing based on size of the inmate population, many libraries 
              are understaffed, functioning with a one-person manager. This manager 
              has the sole responsibility for all aspects of the library operations. 
              Areas of operation may include collection management, reader&#8217;s 
              advisory, reference questions, Internet searches, hiring, training, 
              supervising inmate workers, and working daily with security to ensure 
              inmates get permission to visit the library. Each library employs 
              inmate workers who assist in all areas of the library processing, 
              circulation, reference etc. Librarians, however, must be constantly 
              vigilant as inmate workers, though very helpful, by the very nature 
              of the prison culture, are likely to engage in manipulative games, 
              some of which may compromise security.[<a name="f7b" id="f7b"></a></span><a href="#f7" class="back">Fn7</a><span class="text">] 
              In cases where there is no budget for substitute staff, the libraries 
              close when the librarian takes leave. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Each year, MCEL produces an online <em>Directory 
              of State Prison Librarians</em> from a questionnaire sent to each 
              state prison.[<a name="f8b" id="f8b"></a></span><a href="#f8" class="back">Fn8</a><span class="text">] 
              The directory lists the name, qualification, address, and employing 
              authority. Prison libraries may be staffed by librarians with a 
              degree in Library Science or an undergraduate degree, or by technicians 
              under the supervision of an off site professional librarian. The 
              libraries and education departments may be under the jurisdiction 
              of the Division of Correction (DOC), or they may exist through the 
              collaborative efforts of the DOC, and other agencies. For example, 
              the Maryland State Department of Education employs MCEL librarians, 
              but that agency receives a subvention from the Maryland&#8217;s 
              DOC to implement most of the library programs. In this case, funding 
              includes an off site online legal database service that serves to 
              provide inmates with access to the courts. While this writer is 
              aware that private contractors operate a number of prisons, none 
              of the librarians responding to the survey indicated private contractors 
              employed them.<a name="zw7"></a></span></p>
            <p class="textueberschrift1">Library Access</p>
            <p class="text">Inmates&#8217; access to the library varies by institutions, 
              with some libraries operating day and evening hours, seven days 
              a week, to any inmate who is on recreation, while others have limited 
              hours and more controlled access. Librarians must also deliver services 
              to inmates who are segregated from the general population either 
              for protection or because of institutional infractions. Inmates 
              on segregated status receive library services by writing requests 
              using the in house institution mail, or if the institution allows 
              inmate clerks in the cell blocks, they collect and deliver services 
              at scheduled times. Services to segregated units are challenging 
              for librarians because the correctional staff are often lackadaisical 
              or whimsical in their manner or support of the service provider.</p>
            <p class="text">Physical access to the library, especially during 
              summer months, is sometimes hindered by institution lockdowns, when 
              there is no inmate movement on the compound. If the duration of 
              the lockdown is more than one week, the librarian answers and delivers 
              information requests through the institution mail. <a name="zw8"></a></p>
            <p class="textueberschrift1">Censorship</p>
            <p><span class="text">Although <em>The Standards</em> assert Prisoners 
              right to read, and non-censorship except for obvious security and 
              pornographic issues, many librarians face intense and often unwarranted 
              scrutiny by prison security staff who tries to impose restrictions 
              on certain library materials. Seasoned Librarians, using the Library 
              Bill of Rights and established guidelines constantly challenge attempts 
              at censorship, but others admit to abiding by the strictures of 
              the DOC. In a recent discussion list, one librarian shared the challenge 
              of balancing her job as a librarian with security issues. Her collection 
              included the very popular Manga series, but with the recent addition 
              of a sex offender unit, the institution was concerned these may 
              have negative effect on the treatment of the sex offenders.[<a name="f9b" id="f9b"></a></span><a href="#f9" class="back">Fn9</a><span class="text">] 
              The present political climate highly favors providing funds for 
              faith-based prison programs and states, vying for these funds, have 
              actually implemented faith based prison programs.[<a name="f10b" id="f10b"></a></span><a href="#f8" class="back">Fn10</a><span class="text">] 
              </span><span class="text"> To date no librarian has reported any

            <p class="textueberschrift1">Technology</p>
            <p><span class="text">Prisoners have access to computers with application, 
              legal, and educational software but they do not have access to the 
              Internet. This means a prisoner with a long incarceration period, 
              who is returning to the community, will be at a disadvantage in 
              seeking and retrieving information for his or her survival. In 2002, 
              MCEL developed a CD-Rom tutorial that simulated the Internet, to 
              teach inmates how to use the Internet.[<a name="f11b" id="f11b"></a></span><a href="#f11" class="back">Fn11</a><span class="text">] 
              This CD-Rom highlights the job, and housing information that the 
              inmate will need on reentry to the community. It has been requested 
              by several states and is now used in those prisons, juvenile, and 
              youth centers across the United States.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Prison librarians report they have computers with 
              Internet access, but these computers must be kept in an area, inaccessible 
              to inmates. Inmate&#8217;s requests for information that is available 
              on the Internet must be submitted and delivered at a future time.<a name="zw10"></a></p>
            <p class="textueberschrift1">Collaborations, partnerships</p>
            <p><span class="text">Prison librarians work as one person managers 
              in isolation from their other library counterparts and without the 
              daily camaraderie and support enjoyed by public and academic librarians. 
              For this article, this writer sent an on line questionnaire to public 
              and prison library listservs, inquiring about service to disadvantaged 
              groups to investigate collaborations.[<a name="f12b" id="f12b"></a></span><a href="#f12" class="back">Fn12</a><span class="text">] 
              The Office of Literacy and Outreach Services of the American Library 
              Association suggested that the term &#8222;underserved&#8221; or 
              &#8222;unserved&#8221; be substituted for &#8222;disadvantaged&#8221;, 
              because the latter often refers to poor people. Libraries, they 
              say, provide services to people who may not be poor or even at risk, 
              but who are merely limited in their information access due to the 
              absence of technology, disabilities, or even the level of resources, 
              financial or otherwise. Although prisoners fit the category of underserved, 
              they did not feature very much in the responses. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Public librarians considered their disadvantaged 
              user groups as residents living in assisted living facilities&#8217;: 
              the elderly, the homebound, new immigrants who have limited English 
              skills, children with learning disabilities, persons with disabilities, 
              patients in Community health care centers, and participants in Literacy 
              programs. Of the 21 respondents, eight donate their discarded books 
              to the jails and detention centers, one library makes regular stops 
              to Youth Centers as part of an arrangement with the court, and another 
              visits a Youth Center as part of the services under their Youth 
              and Adult Services Division. Youth Centers are the areas where public 
              libraries seem to provide greatest service while jails and detention 
              centers receive marginal services.[<a name="f13b" id="f13b"></a></span><a href="#f13" class="back">Fn13</a><span class="text">] 
              Prisons and prison libraries did not feature as a part of their 
              constituents. Prison librarians confirmed that they receive discarded 
              or left overs from book sales, and materials on Interlibrary Loan.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Recognizing the benefits prison libraries could gain 
              from partnerships with public libraries, in 2003, MCEL initiated 
              a program where incarcerated adults read to and with their children 
              and soliciting the help of the Enoch Pratt Public Library (EPFL). 
              The children&#8217;s librarians visited the prison, taught the men 
              how to identify and read appropriate materials to their children, 
              and how to do story telling. There is now an ongoing partnership 
              between MCEL and EPFL. The library provides the prison with a 6-week 
              deposit of children&#8217;s book and makes special arrangements 
              for the children of prisoners to participate in the summer reading 
              game. Other partnership efforts between MCEL and EPFL have been 
              joint presentations at library conferences, one being a presentation 
              entitled &#8222;Has your Public Librarian been to Prison?&#8221; 
              MCEL has also invited Public librarians to do book discussions with 
              the prison librarians at workshops, one session e.g. was called 
              &#8222;Beyond the Bestseller: Alternative Suggestions for Your Patrons.&#8221; 
              Maryland&#8217;s prison librarian also participates in the training 
              opportunities offered by the State Library Resource Center located 
              at the EPFL.<a name="zw11"></a></p>

            <p><span class="text">How does the one person prison library manager 
              keep current with prison library trend or trend in libraries generally? 
              If there is a budget, they participate in state library conferences, 
              special library conferences and workshops, or if they forge relationships 
              with public libraries in their communities, they can participate 
              as those libraries allow. MCEL librarians meet quarterly at different 
              venues, and there are guest speakers from different libraries.<br>
              At the coordinator administrative level, prison librarians get together 
              at the American Library Association&#8217;s annual and mid winter 
              conferences where the Prisoners Forum is a part of the Library Services

              The Prison library Listserv is an extremely important tool for networking. 
              Librarians share stories, pose questions, and offer solutions. It 
              is a helpful tool for librarians new to the prison environment and 
              for library school students who are interested or writing papers 
              on prison librarianship. Another forum for prison librarians is 
              OLOS. On this web site all the libraries that provide services to 
              underserved population are listed. [<a name="f15b" id="f15b"></a></span><a href="#f15" class="back">Fn15</a><span class="text">]<a name="zw12"></a></span></p>

            <p class="textueberschrift1">Conclusion</p>
            <p class="text">Prison library services vary from state to state and 
              from prison to prison as librarians struggle to balance their role 
              as information providers in environments committed to security. 
              Generally, prison librarians operate as community libraries providing 
              collection and services that meet the information, recreation, educational, 
              self help and reentry needs of prisoners whose information needs 
              and reading interests are similar to those of citizens on the outside.<a name="zw13"></a></p>
